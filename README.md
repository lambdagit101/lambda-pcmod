# Lambda's PCMod
This adds computers to Garry's Mod. It has plenty of apps you can use, and you can even build/destroy/repair a PC in-game

### Story
I wanted to make some custom content for my DarkRP server which I gave up on now. Decided it was too good to not put on the workshop.

### Credits
Me - shitty coding, keystroke sounds

Apple - startup sound
